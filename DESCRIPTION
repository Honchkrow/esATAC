Description: This package provides a framework and
    complete preset pipeline for the quantification
    and analysis of ATAC-seq and DNase-seq Reads.
    It covers a complete workflow
    starting from raw sequence reads,
    over creation of alignments
    and quality control report, to the quantification of genomic
    regions of interest. The package is managed by dataflow graph,
    and users can also build their own pipeline easily and flexibly.

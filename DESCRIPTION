Title: Pipeline for Quantifying and Annotating ATAC-seq and DNase-seq Reads in R
Version: 0.99.0

Description: This package provides a framework and 
        complete default pipeline for the quantification
        and analysis of ATAC-seq and DNase-seq Reads. 
        It covers a complete workflow
        starting from raw sequence reads, 
        over creation of alignments
        and quality control report, to the quantification of genomic
        regions of interest. 
        Users can buid their own pipeline easily.
